# Environment Variables Documentation

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "3-architecture.md" focusing on "Environment Variables Documentation".

The BMad DiCaster Architecture Document (`3-architecture.md`) indicates that detailed environment variable documentation is intended to be consolidated, potentially in a file named `docs/environment-vars.md`. This file is marked as "(To be created)" within the "Key Reference Documents" section of `3-architecture.md`.

While specific environment variables are mentioned contextually throughout `3-architecture.md` (e.g., for Play.ht API keys, LLM provider configuration, SMTP settings, and workflow trigger API keys), a dedicated, centralized list of all variables, their purposes, and example values is not present as a single extractable section suitable for verbatim sharding at this time.

This sharded document serves as a placeholder, reflecting the sharding plan's intent to capture "Environment Variables Documentation". For specific variables mentioned in context, please refer to the full `3-architecture.md` (particularly sections like API Reference, Infrastructure Overview, and Security Best Practices) until a dedicated and consolidated list is formally compiled as intended.
