## Branding & Style Guide Reference

- **Color Palette:** Use Tailwind's default color palette, with `#800080` (purple) as a custom accent color if needed.
- **Typography:** Use Tailwind's default font family (sans-serif) and semantic classes for headings (e.g., `text-2xl font-bold`) and body text (e.g., `text-base`).
- **Iconography:** Use a minimalist icon set (e.g., Font Awesome), styled with Tailwind classes.
- **Spacing & Grid:** Use Tailwind's utility classes for spacing (e.g., `p-4`, `m-2`) and grid layout (e.g., `grid`, `grid-cols-2`).

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements

- **Target Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 Level A
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons) are focusable and operable using the keyboard.
  - Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML5 elements for structure and meaning (e.g., `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<button>`).
  - Alternative Text: Provide descriptive alternative text for images (if any are used).
  - Color Contrast: Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background elements.

## Responsiveness

- **Breakpoints:** Use Tailwind's default breakpoints: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
- **Adaptation Strategy:** Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to apply styles conditionally at different breakpoints.
  - For example:
    - `text-base md:text-lg` (base font size on small screens, larger on medium screens and up).
    - `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (single-column grid on small screens, two-column grid on medium screens and up).
