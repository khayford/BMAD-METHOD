**Master Checklist Report - BMad DiCaster MVP Plan**

**Date of Review:** May 14, 2025

**Documents Reviewed:**

- `prd.txt` (as updated by `arch-suggested-changes.txt`, `fea-suggested-changes.txt`, and checklist findings)
- `architecture.txt`
- `front-end-architecture.txt`
- `po-master-checklist.txt` (as the framework for this review)

**Overall Assessment:** The project plan and associated documentation are largely comprehensive and well-structured for MVP development. Key architectural decisions are documented, and the PRD provides a good breakdown of work through epics and stories. The iterative review has identified areas for clarification and addition, primarily within the PRD's stories and acceptance criteria, which have been noted for incorporation.

| Category                                     | Status            | Critical Issues / Key Findings & Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Project Setup & Initialization**        | LARGELY COMPLIANT | - **Recommendation:** Add AC to Story 1.1 for creating a basic project `README.md` (Approved).\<br\>- Local dev setup relies on Vercel/hosted Supabase DB (User Clarification).\<br\>- Core dependencies and package management are clear.\<br\>- `docs/environment-vars.md` and `.env.example` (Story 1.8) are crucial for config.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **2. Infrastructure & Deployment Seq.**      | LARGELY COMPLIANT | - **Action:** Add new stories to Epic 1 for core config table creation (1.10) and seed data (1.11). Add ACs for migrations to relevant stories (1.4, 2.3, 3.2, 3.3, 4.2) (Approved).\<br\>- RLS deferred for MVP per PRD.\<br\>- API/Service config clear. Webhook security AC for Story 5.3 to be conditional (Approved).\<br\>- Deployment via standard Vercel GitHub integration (User Clarification).\<br\>- **Action:** Add new Story 1.12 (Epic 1) for test framework setup (Approved). Architect to detail broader mocking strategy in `architecture.txt`. |
| **3. External Dependencies & Integrations**  | LARGELY COMPLIANT | - **Action:** Story 1.8 AC refined to include guidance on obtaining third-party credentials, checking rate limits, and cost awareness (Approved).\<br\>- Fallback for LLM and podcast exists. For HN API/Email, retries are MVP scope.\<br\>- Infrastructure services (Vercel CDN, Email config) are covered. Custom domain not MVP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **4. User/Agent Responsibility Delineation** | COMPLIANT         | - User responsibilities (account creation, credential provision, manual data mgmt for MVP) are clear.\<br\>- Developer agent responsibilities (code, automation, config mechanisms, testing) are clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **5. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies**     | COMPLIANT         | - Functional, technical, and cross-epic dependencies are well-managed by sequential epic structure.\<br\>- Incremental value delivery is maintained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **6. MVP Scope Alignment**                   | COMPLIANT         | - Epics/stories align with PRD goals. No extraneous features.\<br\>- Critical user journeys covered. Error/UX/Accessibility addressed by architecture docs & Epic 6 general note (User chose to ignore findings for more explicit PRD ACs here).\<br\>- Technical requirements & constraints from PRD are met by architecture. Performance considerations addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **7. Risk Management & Practicality**        | LARGELY COMPLIANT | - **Action:** Add performance validation ACs to Story 4.3, 6.2, 6.3 (Approved). No explicit prototyping stories for LLM/Play.ht (User Decision). User will manually assess summarization quality.\<br\>- External dependency risks have mitigations (facades, retries, some fallbacks).\<br\>- Timeline Practicality: Sequential story development (BMAD method) is a key constraint impacting parallelism (User Clarification - "Not Compliant by Design" for parallel work).                                                                                    |
| **8. Documentation & Handoff**               | LARGELY COMPLIANT | - Developer docs (architecture, `README.md`, inline code via DoD) are planned.\<br\>- User docs (for end-users) not needed for MVP simplicity. Setup docs for admin/dev covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **9. Post-MVP Considerations**               | COMPLIANT         | - Clear separation of MVP/future features. Architecture supports enhancements. Extensibility points exist.\<br\>- Analytics (Vercel option), informal feedback, basic monitoring (logs, DB table) are acceptable for MVP. Performance measurement ACs added. Proactive alerting not MVP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
